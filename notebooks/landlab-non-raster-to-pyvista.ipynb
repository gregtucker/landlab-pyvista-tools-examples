    "# Translating a Landlab non-raster grid into PyVista for visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "*Greg Tucker, CU Boulder, June 2025*\n",
    "\n",
    "PyVista offers powerful 3D visualization capabilities for geoscientific data. This tutorial shows how to translate a non-raster Landlab grid into a pair of PyVista objects that can be viewed interactively as 3D surfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `llpytools` package offers a function called `grid_to_pv` that translates the contents of a Landlab grid and its fields into (generally) two PyVista mesh objects, one for each of the two dual meshes that compose most Landlab grids. In one of the resulting PyVista meshes, the points are Landlab grid *nodes* and the cells are Landlab grid *patches*. In the other, the points are Landlab grid *corners* and the cells are Landlab grid *cells*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The dual nature of Landlab grids\n",
    "\n",
    "Most Landlab grid types contain two complementary or \"dual\" meshes. One mesh is built around a set of points called *nodes*. Adjacent pairs of nodes are joined by directed line segments called *links*. Nodes form the vertices for a set of polygons called *patches*. In a `RasterModelGrid`, for example, the nodes are arranged in a regular, rectilinear pattern; its patches are rectangles, and the links are the edges of these rectangles. In a `HexModelGrid`, the nodes are the vertices of a set of equilateral triangles. (For illustrations and examples, see Hobley et al. (2017)).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the mesh of nodes-links-patches, a Landlab grid (other than the special `NetworkModelGrid`) contains a dual mesh. The elements of this dual mesh are called, in Landlab terminology, corners, faces, and cells. In a `RasterModelGrid`, this dual is itself a regular rectilinear grid. In a grid that uses a Delaunay triangulation for nodes, the dual mesh is a Voronoi diagram. This reflects the fact that the Delaunay triangular and Voronoi tesselation are dual to one another: each Vornoi polygon represents the area of space that is closer to the node within it than to any other node in the grid, and the vertices of the Voronoi polygons are the circumcenters of the Delaunay triangles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of the motivation for this dual-mesh model is to support the implementation of finite-difference and finite-volume numerical methods on Landlab grids. Finite-difference methods need to have discrete points at which solutions are tracked; finite-volume methods (in 2d) require polygons. Having a dual mesh allows one to have both of these: every *cell* in a Landlab grid has a *node* inside; all nodes except those around the perimeter sit inside cells. For more, see Hobley et al. (2017) and Barnhart et al. (2020). Many Landlab components use a combination of nodes, links, and cells; it is also possible, though less widely done to date, to use corners, faces, and patches.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A note on terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "Landlab and PyVista use somewhat different terminology for grid elements. In PyVista, a *cell* is a 2d or 3d geometric object. In Landlab, *cell* refers to a polygon in one of a grid's two complementary meshes. In this tutorial, the two will generally be distinguished by referring specifically to a \"Landlab cell\" or \"PyVista cell\"."

    "## A tiny example\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate how Landlab's data structures translate into PyVista's, it is useful to start with a tiny example. Here we create a Landlab `RadialModelGrid`, a type of grid that uses a Delaunay triangulation to connect *nodes* into a mesh of triangular *patches*, and a corresponding Voronoi diagram that defines the Landlab *cells* and their vertices, which in Landlab-speak are called *corners*.\n",
    "\n",
    "This mesh will have 2 *rings*, meaning that the grid has a central node plus two \"rings\" of nodes. We will ask Landlab to put 5 nodes in the innermost (first) ring. This arrangement will create a node-link-patch mesh with 16 nodes, 35 links, and 20 triangular patches. The dual mesh will have 19 nodes, 25 faces, and 6 cells. One of the 6 cells will be a pentagon; the others will be hexagons: a useful arrangement if we want to demonstrate translation of a Landlab grid that has polygons with differing numbers of sides.\n",
